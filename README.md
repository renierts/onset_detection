## Summary and Contents
This is a template repository for code accompanying a research paper and should allow 
to reproduce the results from the paper.

This template provides everything to getting started. and it can directly be used
for basically any research paper.

We propose to use the following structure of this README:
- Title of the paper
- Metadata:
    - Metadata contains the author names, journal/conference, weblinks, such as the 
Digital Object Identifier(DOI)etc.
- Summary and Contents:
    - The summary is typically not the abstract of the paper but a summary of what the
     repo containts.
     - Take care of the Copyright of the publisher
- File list:
    - The file list contains all files provided in the repository together with a 
    short description.
- Usage:
    - How can users get started with your research code. This contains setting up a 
    installing packages in a virtual environment `venv` and running one `main.py` that
    includes your main code. 
    - Very important and often forgotten: How can the data to reproduce the results be
    obtained?
    - In case of a Jupyter notebook, it is strongly recommended to add a link to 
    [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).
- Acknowledgments:
    - Any kind of required funding information 
    - other acknowledgments, such as project partners, contributors, family etc.
- License:
    - Reference to the license of your code - how can readers re-use it?
    - Which defaults?
- Referencing:
    - How can your work be cited? Ideally, provide a bibtex entry of the paper.

## File list
- The following scripts are provided in this repository
    - `scripts/run.sh`: UNIX Bash script to reproduce the Figures in the paper.
    - `scripts/run_jupyter-lab.sh`: UNIX Bash script to start the Jupyter Notebook for 
   the paper.
    - `scripts/run.bat`: Windows batch script to reproduce the Figures in the paper.
    - `scripts/run_jupyter-lab.bat`: Windows batch script to start the Jupyter Notebook 
  for the paper.
- The following python code is provided in `src`
    - `src/file_handling.py`: Utility functions for storing and loading data and models.
    - `src/preprocessing.py`: Utility functions for preprocessing the dataset
    - `src/main.py`: The main script to reproduce all results.
- `requirements.txt`: Text file containing all required Python modules to be installed
if we are working in Python. It can be obtained by typing 
`pip freeze > requirements.txt` in a PowerShell or in a Bash. 
- `README.md`: The README displayed here.
- `LICENSE`: Textfile containing the license for this source code. You can find 
- `data/`: The optional directory `data` contains
    - `train.csv`: Training data as CSV file
    - `test.csv`: Test data as CSV file
- `results/`
    - (Pre)-trained modelss.
    - Results as CSV file.
- `.gitignore`: Command file for Github to ignore files with specific extensions. This
is useful to keep the repository clean. Templates for many programming languages are 
available [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

## Usage
The easiest way to reproduce the results is to use a service like 
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) and run the Jupyter Notebook (if available). It is 
nowadays highly recommended, because this does not even require a local installation 
and Jupyter Notebooks are very intuitive to use.

Do not forget to add a badge from Binder as below. Therefore, you can simply paste the
link to your Github repository [here](https://mybinder.org/) and Binder will do the 
rest for you.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/TUD-STKS/SupplementalCodeTemplate/HEAD?labpath=src%2FExample-Notebook.ipynb)

To run the scripts or to start the Jupyter Notebook locally, at first, please ensure 
that you have a valid Python distribution installed on your system. Here, at least 
Python 3.8 is required.

You can then call `run_jupyter-lab.ps1` or `run_jupyter-lab.sh`. This will install a new 
[Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), which is our recommended way 
of getting started.

To manually reproduce the results, you should create a new Python venv as well.
Therefore, you can run the script `create_venv.sh` on a UNIX bash or `create_venv.ps1`
that will automatically install all packages from PyPI. Afterwards, just type 
`source .virtualenv/bin/activate` in a UNIX bash or `.virtualenv/Scripts/activate.ps1`
in a PowerShell.

The individual steps to reproduce the results should be in the same order as in the 
paper. Great would be self-explanatory names for each step.

At first, we import required Python modules and load the dataset, which is already 
stored in `data`. 

```python
from file_handling import (load_data)


training_data = load_data("../data/train.csv")
```

Since the data is stored as a Pandas dataframe, we can theoretically multiple features. 
Here, we restrict the data features to the living area. With the function 
`select_features`, we obtain numpy arrays and the feature transformer that can also be
used for transforming the test data later. Next, we normalize them to zero mean and 
unitary variance.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from preprocessing import select_features


X, y, feature_trf = select_features(
    df=training_data, input_features=["GrLivArea"], target="SalePrice")
scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X)
X_train = scaler.transform(X)
y_train = y
```

We optimize a model using a random search.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.utils.fixes import loguniform
from scipy.stats import uniform

from pyrcn.extreme_learning_machine import ELMRegressor


model = RandomizedSearchCV(
    estimator=ELMRegressor(input_activation="relu", random_state=42,
                           hidden_layer_size=50),
    param_distributions={"input_scaling": uniform(loc=0, scale=2),
                         "bias_scaling": uniform(loc=0, scale=2),
                         "alpha": loguniform(1e-5, 1e1)},
    random_state=42, n_iter=200, refit=True).fit(X, y)
```

We load and transform test data.

```python
from file_handling import load_data


test_data = load_data("../data/test.csv")
X = feature_trf.transform(test_data)
X_test = scaler.transform(X)
```

Finally, we predict the test data.

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

After you finished your experiments, please do not forget to deactivate the venv by 
typing `deactivate` in your command prompt.

The aforementioned steps are summarized in the script `main.py`. The easiest way to
reproduce the results is to either download and extract this Github repository in the
desired directory, open a Linux Shell and call `run.sh` or open a Windows PowerShell and
call `run.ps1`. 

In that way, again, a [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is 
created, where all required packages (specified by `requirements.txt`) are installed.
Afterwards, the script `main.py` is excecuted with all default arguments activated in
order to reproduce all results in the paper.

If you want to suppress any options, simply remove the particular option.
